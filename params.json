{"name":"Grevit","tagline":"Grevit - Build your BIM Model in Grasshopper","body":"## What is Grevit?\r\nGrevit allows you to create Revit or AutoCad BIM models directly in Grasshopper easily.\r\n\r\nExporting static geometries is working fine from Rhino but when it comes to a BIM workflow simply exporting is not enough. Static geometries won’t intersect with native Elements and are difficult to enhance with parameters. Redrawing Rhino geometry with native BIM elements often seems to be the only solution. But then, any design change is forcing us to repeat what we just did.\r\n\r\nGrevit does not only create BIM elements from simple Rhino or Grasshopper geometries, it also allows us to update BIM elements in Revit or AutoCad according to our latest design changes while our parameter values remain in place. \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Grevit?
